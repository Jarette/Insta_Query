## Insta Query

### Creadted by: Jarette Greene

### Description:

    		Insta Query is a miniature database management tool which allows the user to SQL query
            xlsx or csv files through the use of a simple and intuitive user interface,
            not requiring the user to know SQL to perform queries, and save the newly generated
            queried table to a new table for its own.

### Goals:

            The goal of this tool is to allow users who collect data but not
            to the degree of needing a full database but large enough that parsing
            through this data can be vvery tedious. Using this tool will allow the
            user to use SQL to parse through data effieciently without the need
            of knowing SQL syntax
