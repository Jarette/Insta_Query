## Insta Query

### Created by: Jarette Greene

### Description:

    		Insta Query is a lightweight database management tool that allows
            users to run SQL queries on XLSX or CSV files through a simple
            and intuitive interface. It does not require users to know
            SQL to perform queries, and it enables them to save the
            generated results as a new table.

### Goals:

            The goal of this tool is to support users who work
            with data sets that are too large to parse manually,
            but not large enough to require a full database system.
            It enables users to efficiently filter and analyze their data
            using SQL-like queriesâ€”without needing to know SQL syntax.
